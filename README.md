- 👋 Hi, I’m @beableandobservable because the username beable was unavailable and I am both be-able and observe-able.
- 👀 I’m interested in being able to file bug reports for 18xx
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that filling this out is a lot of effort just to file a darn bug report.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building undeground volcanic lairs for worthy supervillains. Don't bother applying, if you're worthy enough I'll find you.
- 📫 How to reach me: try telepathy or interpretive dance.
